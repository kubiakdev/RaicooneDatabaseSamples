# RaicooneDatabaseSamples



Simple implementation of different ways to save files in android devices:
- relational database (SQLite example)
- not relational database (ObjectBox example)
- internal storage temporary files (Files as JSON objects)

This project is not running.
It was created only for showing differences in implementation to Raicoone project's members use.
